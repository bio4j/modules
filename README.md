## Bio4j Modules

This is an abstract part of the [Statika](https://github.com/ohnosequences/statika)-based [Bio4j](https://github.com/bio4j/bio4j) module system.

See [presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/ohnoseq/bio4j-plus-statika-managing-module-dependencies-on-the-type-level) about modularizing Bio4j with Statika.

**Note:** This project is in active developement.
